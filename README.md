# Machine Learning Techniques using Breast Cancer Data

**Contributer:**
- Andrew Zhang

This project was similar to my Final Data Mining project, however, for this, I decided to utilize Breast Cancer data and tried to refine my code so it was more concise and accurate. The purpose of this project was to test whether or not Machine Learning techniques can classify Breast Cancer as either benign or malignant given a multitude of biological data.

For the purpose of learning the minute details of various Machine Learning techniques, I used a variety of techniques such as: 
- **Decision Tree**
- **K-Nearest Neighbor**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine**
